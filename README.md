# MVS_DepthNet
This repository is an extension of original PyTorch implementation of 
"MVDepthNet: real-time multiview depth estimation neural network" 
(https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/MVDepthNet)

- The MVDepthNet repository by Wang et. al. generate depth for two images. I have extended it for multiple images.


--- 1.0 Prerequisites:
PyTorch: The PyTorch version used in the implementation is 0.3,
OpenCV,
NumPy

--- 2.0 Run:
python3 MV_DepthNet.py

--- PS: 
1) Download the model paramters from https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/MVDepthNet
2) I have used images and camera parameters from https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/file_formats
